I am a polygamous reader, not a monogamous one.

Reading is a joy. One should never be bored by a book. Either discard or skip.

Building a personal library is a life endeavour.

Stealing the anti-library idea from Umberto Eco, I will modify it to state that a library should consist of:
1. books you've read and want to re-read
2. books you've read and keep for symbolic purposes or reminders
3. books you are reading
4. books you want to read


The books in this list are fall into one of the above categories.
